## PA2 Filling A Pool

Write a C++ program that allows the user to enter a pool's length, width, and depth, in feet measurement. The program will then calculate the pool's volume, the volume of water needed to fill the pool with the water level 3 inches below the top, and the final cost of filling the pool, including the one-time fee $100.00.  
Values entered for the pool sizes could be any postive real numbers.
Because filling a pool/pond with water requires much more water than normal usage, your local city charges a special rate of $0.77 per cubic foot of water to fill a pool/pond. In addi!on, it charges a one-!me fee of $100.00 for filling. If the pool canâ€™t be filled, the cost must be $0.
