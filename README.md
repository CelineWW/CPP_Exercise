## PA1 Rice Field

Write a C++ program that can calculate and display the area and perimeter of any rectangle whose size was entered at the run time of the program.

## PA2 Filling A Pool

Write a C++ program that allows the user to enter a pool's length, width, and depth, in feet measurement. The program will then calculate the pool's volume, the volume of water needed to fill the pool with the water level 3 inches below the top, and the final cost of filling the pool, including the one-time fee $100.00.  
Values entered for the pool sizes could be any postive real numbers.
Because filling a pool/pond with water requires much more water than normal usage, your local city charges a special rate of $0.77 per cubic foot of water to fill a pool/pond. In addi!on, it charges a one-!me fee of $100.00 for filling. If the pool can’t be filled, the cost must be $0.

## PA3 Metric English Coversion

Write a C++ menu-driven program that can convert between the Metric and English systems.
The conversion should exactly cover the following fields and sub-fields:
1. Distance:
▪ Inch to centimeter and reverse order.
(1 inch = 2.54 centimeter)
▪ Foot to meter and reversed order.
(1 foot = 0.3048 meter)
▪ Mile to kilometer and reversed order.
(1 mile = 1.609 kilometer)
2. Weight:
▪ Ounce to the gram and reversed order.
(1 ounce = 28.349 gram)
▪ Pound to kilogram and reversed order.
(1 pound = 0.453 kilogram)
3. Volume:
▪ Ounce to milliliter and reversed order.
(1 ounce = 29.573 milliliter)
▪ Gallon to liter and reversed order.
(1 gallon = 3.785 liter)
▪ Quart to liter and reversed order.
(1 quart = 0.946 liter)
4. Pressure:
▪ PSI to Kg/cm and reversed order.
(1 PSI = 0.07 kg/cm)
5. Temperature
▪ Fahrenheit to Celsius and reversed
order.
[Celsius = (5 / 9) × (Fahrenheit – 32)]
Input validation:
Don’t accept negative values entered for all conversions, except for temperature conversion.

Menu-Driven Program is a program that obtains input from a user by displaying a list of options, known as the menu,
from which the user indicates his/her choice. From a choice, it might lead to a sub-menu with another nested set of
choices. After being done and exiting a choice from the sub-menu, it must go back to the main menu. And only exiting
from the main menu will end the program. With a choice, there could be several nested sub-menus. So, when a sub-
menu is done it must go back to its outer menu. (2 points deducted for NOT USING the pattern)
